# Code Analysis Report

## High Level Overview
The codebase under review appears to have a significant bug related to incorrect module usage, specifically within the 'task_runner.py' file. The bug arises due to the code attempting to use the 'Except' attribute from the 'ast' module, an attribute which does not exist. This suggests issues with the code's overall quality, as it indicates potential logic errors and deficiencies in exception handling. Addressing this bug is a high priority in order to ensure the code works as intended.

Additionally, future improvements to avoid such errors should include an automated code review system and better development practices, such as consistent use of error handling blocks and frequent code logic reviews.

## Detailed Findings
- **Issue 1: Incorrect Attribute Usage in Module (ast.Except)** - The 'ast' module does not contain an attribute named 'Except', suggesting an error in the code in 'task_runner.py'. If this attribute usage is intended, it is wrongly used as it does not exist within the Python's 'ast' module.

- **Issue 2: Potential Logic Error** - The incorrect usage of 'ast.Except' could result from a logic error in the code where the wrong attribute or module is being used.

- **Issue 3: Lack of Runtime Exception Handling** - The error also suggests a lack of sufficient exception handling, as the code fails when attempting to access an attribute that does not exist within the used module(based on the error message).

## Actionable Recommendations
1. **Quick Fix: Review 'ast' Module Usage** - Developers should review the 'ast' module usage in 'task_runner.py' to ensure correct attributes are used. Refer to Python's official documentation for 'ast' module for correct attribute names and their usage.

2. **Potential Typo: Check for Misspellings** - Check the code for potential misspellings or typographical errors in attribute names, and correct them as necessary.

3. **Identify Custom Attributes** - If the "Except" is supposed to be a custom attribute, validate its proper definition and importation. Ensure it is properly defined and imported. 

4. **Error Handling: Implement Robust Exception Handling** - Enclose module-level operations in try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions. This will make the code more robust and prevent complete failure in case of issues like incorrect attribute usage.

5. **Logic Error Review: Walkthrough** - Consider having a logic review of the entire code, especially the part using the 'ast' module. This will help in identifying the part of the code not behaving as expected and rectify accordingly.

## Future Improvements 
- **Automated Code Reviews:** Automating code reviews can help in detecting these types of errors early in the development cycle. Consider using a static code analysis tool for automated code checking.

- **Consistent Use of Error Handling Blocks:** Consistently using error handling blocks throughout the codebase can help prevent unexpected crashes due to unhandled exceptions and bugs. 

- **Frequent Code Logic Reviews:** Regularly reviewing the logic of the code can prevent errors caused due to mistakes in the logic. This could be done via pairing, or walkthroughs, or regular code reviews.

- **Knowledge Sharing Sessions:** Organizing knowledge sharing sessions among developers can help in avoiding common mistakes and best practices for python coding. 

- **Consider Architectural Changes:** If errors like these are common, consider revisiting the application's architecture and looking for ways to simplify.
  

Consider integrating these suggestions into the team's development practices to maintain the quality, security, and performance of the code going forward.
