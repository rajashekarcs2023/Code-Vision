# CodeVision AI - README

## Overview

**CodeVision AI** is an advanced code analysis and compliance tool designed to assist developers in improving code quality, detecting bugs, optimizing performance, and ensuring compliance with both internal and external standards. By integrating advanced AI-powered tools such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and LlamaIndex, CodeVision AI not only identifies issues but also provides actionable suggestions for improvement. With its flexible architecture, it seamlessly integrates into the CI/CD pipeline, helping developers enforce best practices continuously.

## Features

- **Code Quality Analysis**: Evaluates code readability, maintainability, and adherence to standards like PEP 8.
- **Bug Detection**: Detects potential bugs early in the development process using static analysis tools.
- **Performance Optimization**: Analyzes performance bottlenecks in the code and suggests optimizations.
- **Security Audits**: Performs checks for vulnerabilities, ensuring that the code follows secure coding practices.
- **Internal & External Compliance Checks**: Automatically verifies code compliance with internal company policies and external regulations (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA).
- **AI-Generated Reporting**: Uses GPT-4 and LlamaIndex to generate detailed reports in markdown format, with actionable insights and recommendations for developers.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Provides context-aware feedback by retrieving relevant compliance and code standards from a large corpus stored in Pinecone and LlamaIndex.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI for backend development and API management.
- **Frontend**: Reflex framework for user interaction and file uploads.
- **AI Models**: GPT-4 via OpenAI API for generating actionable insights from the analysis results.
- **Static Analysis**: Pylint and other static analysis tools for performing code quality assessments.
- **Document Retrieval**: LlamaIndex and Pinecone for managing and retrieving large corpuses of compliance and coding standards.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/codevision-ai.git
   cd codevision-ai
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables for OpenAI API Key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
   ```

5. Run the FastAPI backend:
   ```bash
   uvicorn api:app --reload
   ```

6. (Optional) To run the Reflex frontend:
   ```bash
   reflex run
   ```

## Usage

1. Upload your code files through the Reflex-based frontend interface or directly place them in the `uploaded_files` directory.
2. Select the type of analysis (Code Quality, Bug Detection, etc.) from the interface.
3. View the detailed analysis report generated by the AI, including actionable suggestions, compliance checks, and refactoring recommendations.
4. Download the markdown report summarizing the analysis.

## Challenges

- **Understanding Reflex Framework**: Integrating Reflex for frontend and interaction required a deep understanding of its architecture.
- **AI Model Integration**: Managing OpenAIâ€™s responses and integrating them into a coherent system with LlamaIndex presented technical challenges.
- **Complex Compliance Checks**: Ensuring comprehensive coverage of external compliance standards while balancing performance.
  
## Future Enhancements

- **Deeper Compliance Checks**: Ingest a broader range of regulatory documents to provide a thorough review of every compliance requirement.
- **Advanced Refactoring Suggestions**: Improve the system to not only highlight issues but also provide automated code refactoring recommendations.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate CodeVision AI into popular CI/CD pipelines to automatically trigger checks on every commit.
- **Expanded Language Support**: Extend the tool to support languages like Java, C++, and JavaScript.
- **Detailed Visualization**: Add a dashboard for visual tracking of code quality trends, compliance status, and performance metrics.
